      <description>Had to get back to training every day and yesterday&amp;rsquo;s single digit morning was a good time to begin anew. The goal is five miles with a loaded pack each day, with a couple 10+ mile walks each week, on the way to 20+. Only skipping days with dangerous weather I&amp;rsquo;d hunker down for anyway. Beyond the obvious health benefits, training made a huge difference in getting through the depression from illness and loss.</description>

      <description>After spending a few years offline much of the time, followed by six months of being online much of the time, it has become clear I need to find some balance.
A healthy balance means more time offline than on. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a long, sometimes contentious, relationship with the internet. Compuserve on the home Mac LC 520 was terrible but offered a glimpse of what could be. Using regular internet at the movie rental place I was working in &amp;lsquo;96, I discovered Gamespot and what was The Bowie File.</description>

      <description>I need a place to collect my thoughts, memories, photos, and other media. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally forgetful, and much has been lost already. Writing things down sometimes helps me take a different perspective, as I write, and edit, and rewrite, and edit, and so on.
Not looking to be monetized or have anyone look at advertisements, so this is built in Hugo, hosted on Netlify, and deployed from a repo on Github.</description>

      <description>author&amp;rsquo;s note: I found writing terrible poetry remarkably therapeutic one evening
Nothing to keep me here
no reason to stay
got a good backpack
a map shows the way
My shoes will wear out
and socks&amp;rsquo;ll get thin
holes in the rain gear
I&amp;rsquo;ll start over again
Farm and land are gone
home and family too
no use in crying
only one thing to do
Keep walking the path
and checking the sky</description>
