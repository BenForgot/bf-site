Had to get back to training every day and yesterday's single digit morning was a good time to begin anew. The goal is five miles with a loaded pack each day, with a couple 10+ mile walks each week, on the way to 20+. Only skipping days with dangerous weather I'd hunker down for anyway. Beyond the obvious health benefits, training made a huge difference in getting through the depression from illness and loss. Those thoughts have been creeping back in so now is the time to get moving again. I was back at it on this even colder morning and stayed nice and warm.

The plan was to leave at the beginning of November before the real cold set in. I had enough cash to get somewhere warmer and eat until getting situated. With health returning, I was back to walking miles without terrible pain or fatigue and there was no compelling reason to stay through another Maine winter.

In October some friends offered me a job at the restaurant they were opening in January. It sounded perfect, I'd be back in a kitchen and best of all I'd have it all to myself in the off hours. Would be able to save up more money which might make my long wander more likely to succeed. So Plan A became Plan B with an indefinitely pushed back timetable. Should have known new Plan A was too good to be true, and as January dragged on, the job vanished due to lack of capital.

No longer have as much cash as I did in October and it's much colder than in November. Won't be able to take my firearms with me, so those will be sold off along with some power tools. Except this computer, those are the last of my possessions that don't go in my pack.

A design gig I scored will bring in a few hundred more. Should be enough for the gear left to buy and a ticket out. Food budget may be smaller but I rarely go hungry after years of creative poverty. I'm still lacking an actual second or third plan, beyond keeping an eye out for work which is comically unlikely in this region of Maine in winter.
