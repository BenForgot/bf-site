I need a place to collect my thoughts, memories, photos, and other media. I'm naturally forgetful, and much has been lost already. Writing things down sometimes helps me take a different perspective, as I write, and edit, and rewrite, and edit, and so on.

Not looking to be monetized or have anyone look at advertisements, so this is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted on  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and deployed from a repo on [Github](https://github.com/BenForgot/bf-site). I will tweak [the theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/) when there's time and motivation.

Think I will implement staticman for commenting, as disqus really sucks.

### So hey me, site goals ^
