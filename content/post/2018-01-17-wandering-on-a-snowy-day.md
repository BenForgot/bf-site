*A smile and a wave to those who drive by thinking I look like a criminal or crazy person*

### Could be a bit of both.

The shortest route to the nearest trailhead is 1.7 miles (2.7 km) though it usually ends up being a longer meandering walk there. A few ways have pleasant views and some elevation gain. Since the goal is to walk further, I try to do more when feasible. **It also gets a bit dull treading the same path day after day.**

Today while at the waterfront that leads to the steepest hill in town, geese circled around me a half dozen times before coming in for a landing on the flats. Geese? In January? Perhaps they know something about the weather I'm not aware of yet. Ducks were already in the mud, feasting and chattering away. Observed them for another minute and walked on 'cause I'd sit there watching until the tide came in otherwise.

There weren't too many on the road this snowy morning, most were accommodating and cut a wide bearth even though I get the hell out of road. Catch those funny looks though, guess I shouldn't expect any different walking in a storm with a huge backpack for no apparent reason. People assume those who walk are doing so because they got picked up for DUI or some other moving violation. I simply have never been good at keeping my papers in order. When it came time to renew I was of the mindset of having no need or obligation to pay for the right to *officially exist.*

Yesterday I found a little stream that had frozen over suddenly when the temperature last plummeted. Chickadees were chick-a-deeing and the sun found a gap in the canopy, shining warmly on my face. One of the most soothing sounds to me is water rushing and burbling under ice. I sat down on my pack and soaked it in. Soon I lowered my eyes and started focusing on my breath; noting the birds, the sunlight through the trees, and the constant flow of the stream.

### Not the first time I've found meditating outside in the cold to get a bit weird.

Perhaps it was strenuous exercise combined with insufficient calories, but wow, that hasn't happened in a while. Being outside myself, the world getting all whirly, that warm and fuzzy sense of peace. I almost talked myself out of going for a walk that day and would have missed it. **< Need to remember that next time**. I felt great the rest of the day, got home and cooked a healthy dinner, and later slept well for the first time in weeks.

Today's meditation wasn't so eventful but pleasant nevertheless. Much quieter, the birds were holed up and a blanket of snow muffled the stream. So quiet when snowing, that faintest hiss as the flakes whirl about, muting all else. Walked down a different spur that ended up wrapping back to the one I came in on, so I headed for home taking the shortest route. Moving on, step-by-step.
