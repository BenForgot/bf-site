*author's note: I found writing terrible poetry remarkably therapeutic one evening*

Nothing to keep me here<br>
no reason to stay<br>
got a good backpack<br>
a map shows the way

My shoes will wear out<br>
and socks'll get thin<br>
holes in the rain gear<br>
I'll start over again

Farm and land are gone<br>
home and family too<br>
no use in crying<br>
only one thing to do

Keep walking the path<br>
and checking the sky<br>
weather changes quick<br>
no sense asking why

A home on my back<br>
my plot where I lay<br>
try to disturb little<br>
for as long as I stay
