### Hi, my name is Ben!
- I'm 6' (182 cm) tall, weigh 155 lbs (70 kg), and my hometown is Boothbay, Maine
- You're welcome to my identity if you want it, not sure you do
- I'm extremely dull, more so as I get older
- Also kinda stupid, less so as I get older
- I like it when people laugh at my dumb jokes
- Umm... I have nice hair and also pretty blue eyes 'cause myopia

### My history
I've been a designer, a barista, a programmer, a baker, a shepherd, a farmer, a data analyst, a landscaper, a clerk, a bum, and probably a few other things I've forgotten.

Worked in corporate, at home, in creative, the service industry, on farms, down at the plant, at newspapers, food service, in the field, in the woods, and on the coast.

I've lived in the forest, in the country, in town, and in the city. Have been well off financially down to spanging to get by. None of those things define who I am.

### Like everything else, they were learning experiences.
